We develop models in Artificial Intelligence (AI) - more precisely Natural Language Generation (NLG) - and combine them with scientific findings from communication research to make communication easier for people.
Our Communicaite tool is a software integration that - based on a few keywords - helps with the automated creation of personal messages. Users can fine-tune whether they want to communicate more extroverted, formally or eloquently, for example.

Sponsored by the German state Communicaite has the noble goal of teaching computers how to communicate like polite humans.
